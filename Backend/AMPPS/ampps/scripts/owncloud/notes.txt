1. Manual installation on any suPHP server only.
2. Add the following query in `oc_preferences` table in sql
('[[admin_username]]', 'core', 'lang', '[[language]]');
3. Make data directory in /home/soft. change path in manual installation.
4. It does not work on windows, we have disabled from 8.1.1.
5. Add [[admin_username]] folder from data_dir to data.zip with folder name as "admin"
6. Check and change version in upgrade.php to upgrade latest version from old.
7. Change <min_require> in info.xml for major version. (We have allowed to 9.1.0 check in the next release)
8. "data"  folder in the softpath is created by default but we maintain it in softadatadir (as recommended by the vendor) hence not to be taken.
9. Due to this "data" folder, the below mentioned entry is removed from sql :
('local::/{{softpath}}/data/', 2);
and make softdatadir -> "numeric_id" as 2. (No need to perform this since 8.2.0 does not make this entry in manual installation itself.)
10. rootcerts.crt in datadir is same for different servers, hence we have added in data.zip.
11. Remove oc_authtoken,oc_filecache, oc_file_locks, oc_mounts entries and change auto increment value accordingly (Since 9.1.0). Check that it genereates after login in every release.

14. Also we have disabled upgrade to version 10.2.1 due to this issue mentioned here https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/35282 . Check the same and enable upgrade in next version.
