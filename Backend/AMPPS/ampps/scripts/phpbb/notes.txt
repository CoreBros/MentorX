While installing, Select Database type : MySQL with MySQLi Extension 

1. Add [[language]] in sql. Take reference from older sql.
2. Apart from english, download ext, languages and styles folder from :
http://www.phpbb.com/languages/?from=submenu
and unzip it to ext, languages and styles folder.
ext is added in phpBB 3.2.0 hence is not available for few languages.
3. Update once manually to check if database is updated properly
4. Add as many languages as you can.
5. If you want to add language add its entry in install.php as well.
6. Update the file database_update.php (from original zip under install directory) and _database_update.php (from original zip + our changes) of the new version. This change is for auto upgrade. (Not required since 3.2.1)
Following is our change :

// Softaculous Change
$config['default_lang'] = 'en';

7. have removed <option value="pt_br">Portuguese Brazilian</option> in 3.1.6 and 3.1.7-pl1. Portuguese Brazilian zip sturcture was wrong and was not compatible with older zip. Add it back (in install.xml and install.php)in next version if structure is correct.
8. Check for "rand_seed" and "rand_seed_last_update" value in database for next update, it gets generated on localhost but not on linux servers (since v3.2.0).
9. phpbb_viglink_api_key in database is default key at "ext\phpbb\viglink\migrations\viglink_data.php" check in the next version.
