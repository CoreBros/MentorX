Version 2.3.2 (October 16th, 2019)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

   * Fix: Auto-generated mails submitted to qmail as MTA will get
          mangled if encoded to quoted-printable due to qmail
          changing "\r\n" linebreaks to "\r\r\n". Submit just "\n"
          as linebreaks; other MTAs should cope with that.

   * fix: Rotating an image did not rotate all responsive thumbnails
   
   * fix: The wysiwyg editor stripped the figcaption element used
          for image captions

   * Only populate $serendipity['GET'], $serendipity['POST'] and
     $serendipity['COOKIE'] with references to $_GET['serendipity'],
     $_POST['serendipity'], $_COOKIE['serendipity'] if they are
     transmitted as an array. Else, an empty array is used.
