1) Do not install with Demo data.
2) Try to add Upgrade capability.
3) Sugar asks only for MySQLi
4) Dont forget to add the "generatepasswordtmpl" and "lostpasswordtmpl" in email_templates table in SQL
5) add 

error_reporting(E_PARSE);

$sugar_config['http_referer']['list'][] = '[[servervar]]'; 

in config_override.php

6) Check and replace custom folder from manual to zip if there are any changes.
7) SugarCRM css breaks on PHP 5.4. So we have added restriction in info.xml. (PHP 5.4 supported since 6.5.26)
