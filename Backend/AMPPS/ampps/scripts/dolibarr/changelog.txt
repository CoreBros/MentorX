The unit were not saved correctly in database making calculation on shipments wrong. 
Update to this version must be done if you use them and have installed version 10.0.0, 10.0.1 or 10.0.2 and set some products after installing or upgrading to one of this version.
Once update is done you must then edit (manually) the product that has bad unit to set the correct unit to have features restored.
