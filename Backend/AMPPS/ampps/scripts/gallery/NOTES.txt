1) Copy the 'var/' (exclude database.php) folder from the manual installation and save it in the .zip
2) While upgrade it is asking to make a directory of random string to avoid that just go to  modules\gallery\controllers\upgrader.php and 
replace 
	"if (file_exists(TMPPATH . $upgrade_token))" 
with 
	"if (!file_exists(TMPPATH . $upgrade_token))"
3) Gallery does not work on Windows.
