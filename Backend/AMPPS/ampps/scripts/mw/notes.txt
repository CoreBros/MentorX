6) The default admin password that we use is changed to 'password1' (instead of 'password' in install.xml) due to the common password check done by the script. (Since version 1.27.0)
7) We have added "tmpdir" in order to save cache at different locations for each installation to avoid conflicts between them. (v1.27.1)
