1. Configure composer.json add [[php_binary]]
2. Add the following in composer.json under config :
"cache-dir": "[[softpath]]/cache"
We add this because by default it takes /root/.composer
3. Make the ZIP after installing Laravel manually
4. Move bootstrap/cache/compiled.php from manual to zip. ( "compiled.php" not generated in Laravel 5.4.0 Check in Next Version )
5. Take care of symbolic link of vendon/bin folder
