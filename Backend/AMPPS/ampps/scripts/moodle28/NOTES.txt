* Do not download Weekly Built.
1) Empty the cache, sessions, muc, lock and localcache folders in data.zip
2) Use "defaultcity" for city while installing, country United States and Timezone America/New_york. Also in New settings - Location settings keep America/New_york
3) Download the Language packs here:
http://download.moodle.org/langpack/
4) Unpack the packages in the /languages/[[language]].zip
5) Change the language [[language]] in SQL config and users table.
6) Check this function and if new file is added update it in upgrade.php:
upgrade_stale_php_files_present() in the file :
/lib/upgradelib.php
7) required minimum version check for upgrade in info.xml should be changed in case of major version change
8) We do not change $CFG->directorypermissions = 0777; in the config file because it is outside the web-accessible directory and does not matter if it is 0777
9) Check if /muc/config.php file is created in data folder on non suPHP server i.e. (you can use Webuzo).
10) `allversionshash` in config table is same for every install
11) `assignfeedback_editpdf` has the value '/usr/bin/gs' on Windows as well as Linux Manual install hence we leave it as it is.
